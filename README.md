# MinimizeToTray

MinimizeToTray is a simple application for Windows. It helps reduce taskbar clutter by allowing you to minimize any open window directly to the system tray. Minimized windows can be easily restored whenever needed. No installation required.

**Basic Usage:**

1.  Launch the MinimizeToTray application.
2.  To minimize the active window to the system tray, press **Alt+F1** (configurable).
3.  To restore the last window you minimized, press **Alt+F2** (configurable).
4.  Alternatively, right-click the MinimizeToTray icon in the system tray to see a list of all minimized applications. Click any application in the list to restore its window.

Some processes may need MinimizeToTray to be run with Admin privileges to be hidden.
